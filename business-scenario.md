# Contoso Outdoors — Business Scenario

This document describes the business scenario for the .NET Agent Framework workshop.

## 1. Business Scenario

**Contoso Outdoors** is an outdoor and adventure gear retailer. Customers browse products, place orders, track deliveries, request returns, and ask about gear recommendations. The company sells tents, backpacks, footwear, clothing, cooking gear, and accessories for hiking, camping, and trail running.

Customer service agents handle requests ranging from simple product lookups to multi-step scenarios like processing a return, recommending the right gear for a trip, or explaining why an order is delayed. Agents have access to the product catalog, customer order history, knowledge base (sizing guides, care instructions, policies), and product images stored in Azure Blob Storage.

## 2. Backend Systems

| System | Description | Data Types |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Customer Database** | Customer profiles with loyalty tiers and account status | Names, emails, addresses, loyalty tier (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum) |
| **Order Management** | Orders with line items, shipping status, and tracking | Order status (placed/processing/shipped/delivered/returned/cancelled), tracking numbers, delivery estimates |
| **Product Catalog** | Full product inventory with descriptions, pricing, and availability | Product details, categories, stock status, ratings, images |
| **Promotions Engine** | Active sales, discounts, and loyalty-tier-specific deals | Discount percentages, eligible categories, loyalty tier requirements |
| **Support Tickets** | Customer support cases tied to orders | Ticket status, priority, category (shipping/product-issue/return/general) |
| **Knowledge Base** | Guides, policies, and procedures as searchable documents | Sizing guides, care instructions, return policies, warranty info (vector-searchable via Azure AI Search) |
| **Product Image Store** | Product photos stored in Azure Blob Storage | High-quality product images proxied through BFF to browser (agents include `imageFilename` in markdown responses) |

## 3. Customer Scenarios

These scenarios are seeded into the data and have deterministic expected outcomes. Use them to test and validate agent behavior.

### Scenario 1 — "Where's my order?"

**Customer:** Emma Wilson (ID: 101)
**Question:** *"I placed an order a few days ago — can you tell me where it is?"*

**What the agent should do:**
1. Look up Emma's orders → find Order 1001 (status: `shipped`, tracking: `TRK-29481`)
2. Report the order is shipped with tracking number and estimated delivery date

**Systems accessed:** Customer Database, Order Management
**Agent route:** Orchestrator → CRM Agent

### Scenario 2 — "These boots don't fit"

**Customer:** James Chen (ID: 102)
**Question:** *"I got my hiking boots but they're too small. Can I return them?"*

**What the agent should do:**

3. Search products in the "tents" category → show matching products with images
4. Confirm Sarah qualifies for the promotion based on her loyalty tier

**Systems accessed:** Customer Database, Promotions, Product Catalog
**Agent route:** Orchestrator → Product Agent
**Note:** Product images are rendered by the React UI from the `imageFilename` field — agents do not retrieve image bytes.

### Scenario 4 — "My jacket arrived damaged"

**Customer:** David Park (ID: 104)
**Question:** *"The jacket I ordered arrived with a tear in the sleeve. What can I do?"*

**What the agent should do:**

2. Check warranty policy in knowledge base → covers manufacturing defects
3. Create a support ticket (category: product-issue, priority: high)
4. Explain options: replacement or refund per the return/exchange procedure

### Scenario 7 — "I want to cancel my order"

**Customer:** Anna Roberts (ID: 107)
**Question:** *"I changed my mind about my order. Can I cancel it?"*

**What the agent should do:**
1. Look up Anna's orders → find Order 1007 (status: `processing` — not yet shipped)
2. Since status is `processing`, explain that cancellation is possible before shipping
3. Create a support ticket for the cancellation request (category: general, priority: medium)

**Systems accessed:** Customer Database, Order Management, Support Tickets

---

### Scenario 8 — "What happened to my refund?"

**Customer:** Tom Garcia (ID: 108)

### Unstructured Data (PDFs → Azure AI Search via integrated vectorization)

Policy documents, guides, and procedures are uploaded to Azure Blob Storage and automatically vectorized by the AI Search indexer (text extraction → chunking → embedding). Stored in the `knowledge-documents` search index for semantic search.

### Product Images (Azure Blob Storage)

Product photos are stored in a `product-images` blob container, organized by product ID and accessible via SAS-signed URLs through the Product Images MCP Server.
